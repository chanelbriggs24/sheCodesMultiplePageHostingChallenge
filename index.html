        <li>
          The origin of the French croissant was known as a kipferl, from
          Austria.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 1839, an individual by the name of August Zang simplified the
          recipe and it became popular in his own bakery that he opened in
          Paris.
        </li>
        <li>
          The French variation of the kipferl was named a croissant because of
          its cresecent shape.
